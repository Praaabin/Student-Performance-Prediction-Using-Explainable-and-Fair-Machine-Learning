## 📋 Overview
This project investigates how machine learning models can be used to predict secondary school student performance and, crucially, how **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** can make these predictions **interpretable, transparent, and fair** across different student subgroups (e.g., gender, parental education).

Unlike existing research that focuses mainly on predictive accuracy, this study aims to produce **transparent and fair** machine learning insights that can support educators in understanding *why* predictions occur and whether they behave equitably.

This repository contains:
- Data preprocessing scripts  
- Machine learning model implementations  
- SHAP & LIME explainability analyses  
- Fairness evaluation tools  
- Visualisations and experiment results  
- Supporting documentation and dissertation artefacts

## 🎯 Research Aim
To develop an interpretable and fair machine learning framework for predicting student academic performance, using Explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) and subgroup fairness evaluation.
